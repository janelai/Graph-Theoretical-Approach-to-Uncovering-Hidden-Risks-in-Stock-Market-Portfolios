## Graph-Theoretical Approach to Uncovering Hidden Risks in Stock Market Portfolios
*Contributors to this project include Jane Lai, Scott Stossel, Daniel Wang, and Kevin Coppa from the University of California, Berkeley.*

This project models stocks as a correlation network to uncover hidden dependencies that traditional sector-based diversification overlooks. Using the Louvain algorithm to detect clusters of correlated assets and PageRank to identify influential stocks, it reveals cross-sector relationships and systemic risks not visible in standard models.
